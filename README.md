Clua
====

This is a Sublime Text 2/3 syntax highlighter for the logs produced by CLua.

To install:
1. Go to Preferences | Browse Packages...
2. Create a folder named 'CLua Log Highlighter'
3. Place the clua_log.tmLanguage in there
Done.

clua_log.YAML-tmLanguage is the source from which clua_log.tmLanguage was built. I used AAAPackageDev.

It was designed specifically for the theme Vibrant Ink. It looks ok in Cobalt, but it may not display correctly with your favored theme. The source is there for a reason.
