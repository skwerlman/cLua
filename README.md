Clua
====

Conditional Lua Combiner!

###What does it do?
Clua allows you to create modular CC Programs and release them as a single file.

###Why'd you make it?
When I saw SquidDev's PPI, I realized that despite it's few flaws, it was a really useful program. But it was missing something. I originally planned to simply modify Squid's source and pass it back to him to distrubute. However, as I looked through it, I realized that in certain cases it was incredibly inefficient, and in athers it simply couldn't do what was required. I decided I'd rework it from the ground up, and, well, here we are.

###How do I use it?
I'm gonna write this bit later, after I've finished the code.
